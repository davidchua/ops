# Ops

Ops is a personal binary I use to manage my own terminal. It consists of a bunch of misc binaries and commands that is designed to be suited for my own personal use as my toolkit.

To switch to a different kubeconfig in ~/.kube/

```
$ ops kube
```

To switch to a different namespace and update context

```
$ ops kube ns
```
